# YOLO_v3_object_detection
This is object detection project with the implementation of YOLOv3 for both custom trained model and pretrained model.

For custom trained model:
Here I collect custom dataset from the site: https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=object%20detection&t=metadata
Then trained custom dataset using yolov3 and get the trained model/weights: 'yolov3_custom_2000.weights'. Here the images are tested using custom trained
model. 

For Pretrained model:
Here 'yolov3-320.cfg' & 'yolov3-tiny.cfg' are used as a pretrained model for object detection.
